# numinia-oncyber

> Oncyber Component Warehouse

This project is a warehouse of components designed to implement various functionalities within the Oncyber platform. These components can be used to enhance and customize spaces or levels in Oncyber.

## Project Structure

Each component of the game is organized into specific directories that represent functionalities, behaviors, and configurations.

### `src`

This directory contains the core of the game's frontend logic, including behaviors, common components, and utilities.

- `behaviors/teleport`: Handles teleportation behaviors within the game.
  - `all-in-one.ts`: Aggregated teleport behavior logic.
  - `ImplementationGuideOverlay.tsx`: Overlay component for implementation guidance.
  - `main.ts`: Main entry point for teleport behaviors.
  - `TeleportBehavior.ts`: Defines teleport behavior functionality.
- `common/components`: Commonly used components across the game.
  - `TeleportAction.ts`: Component handling teleport actions.
- `common/effects`: Visual effects used in the game.
  - `FadeIn.ts`, `FadeOut.ts`: Components for fade-in and fade-out effects.
- `store`: State management components for the game.
  - `App.tsx`: Main application component.
  - `AppStore.ts`: Store for managing application state.
  - `Styles.tsx`: Styling components for the application.
- `utils`: Utility functions and helper classes.
  - `InteractionDirector.ts`: Manages interactions within the game.
- `oo-oncyber.d.ts`: TypeScript declaration file for Oncyber-specific types.

### `backend/openai-worker` (Optional in case you need a backend)

This directory contains the optional server logic and backend functions necessary to interact with the OpenAI API and other backend services. This part of the project is dependent on Cloudflare Workers.

To use the backend functionalities, you will need to upload the files in this directory to Cloudflare by creating a Cloudflare Worker. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Create a Cloudflare Worker**: Log in to your Cloudflare account and navigate to the Workers section. Create a new Worker.

2. **Upload Files**: Upload the necessary files from the `backend/openai-worker` directory to your Cloudflare Worker.

3. **Configure `wrangler.toml`**: Make sure the `wrangler.toml` file is correctly configured with your Cloudflare account details and the settings required for your Worker.

4. **Deploy**: Deploy the Worker using the Cloudflare dashboard or the Wrangler CLI.

Files included:

- `controller.js`: Main controller to handle requests.
- `proxy.js`: Proxy configuration.
- `redirect.js`, `roles.js`, `routes.js`: Additional backend functionalities.
- `service.js`: Handles service-related tasks.
- `worker.js`: Worker configuration.
- `wrangler.toml`: Configuration file for Cloudflare Workers.

## Usage

### 1. Defining Behaviors and Components

Create or modify files within the `src` directory to define new behaviors, components, and utilities for the Oncyber game.

### 2. Implementing Backend Services

Use the `backend/openai-worker` directory to add or update backend services and logic necessary for the game.
