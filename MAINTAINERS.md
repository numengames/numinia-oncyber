### How to Become a Maintainer

We are always looking for contributors who are interested in taking on more responsibility within the project. To become a maintainer, a contributor should:

1. Demonstrate sustained, high-quality contributions to the project.
2. Participate actively in discussions, reviews, and decision-making processes.
3. Show a good understanding of the project's goals, architecture, and codebase.

If you are interested in becoming a maintainer, please reach out to one of the current maintainers listed above.

### Decision-Making Process

Maintainers use the following process for making decisions:

1. **Consensus Seeking**: Whenever possible, decisions are made by seeking consensus among the maintainers. This involves discussing the issue until all maintainers agree on a solution.
2. **Voting**: If consensus cannot be reached, a vote may be taken. Each maintainer gets one vote, and a simple majority determines the outcome.
3. **Final Say**: In the rare event that a decision cannot be resolved through consensus or voting, the lead maintainer has the final say.

### Communication Channels

Maintainers communicate through the following channels:

- **GitHub Issues and Pull Requests**: Primary platform for technical discussions and decisions.
- **Email**: For private communication or sensitive matters.
- **Community Chat (e.g., Slack, Discord)**: For more informal discussions and quick questions.

### Code of Conduct

All maintainers are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and ensure that the community remains a welcoming and respectful place for everyone.

### Release Management

Maintainers are responsible for managing releases. This includes:

- Deciding when a new release is warranted.
- Preparing release notes that document significant changes.
- Tagging releases in the version control system.
- Announcing releases to the community.
